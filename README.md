 How the Project Works:
1.	Real-Time Data Ingestion:
o	Uses Apache Kafka, a popular data streaming platform, to collect live sensor data from manufacturing machines.
o	Streams data continuously, allowing real-time processing.

2.	Data Generation (Simulation):
o	Since real manufacturing data might not be available, synthetic data is generated to simulate normal and abnormal patterns.
o	Data could include metrics like temperature, pressure, vibration, and more.

3.	Anomaly Detection Model:
o	Uses an autoencoder neural network to learn the normal behavior of manufacturing data.
o	Autoencoders are trained to reconstruct normal data patterns with minimal loss.
o	When an anomaly occurs, the model fails to accurately reconstruct the data, leading to high reconstruction loss.

4.	Detection Mechanism:
o	Sets a threshold for loss based on the distribution of normal data.
o	Flags anomalies when the loss exceeds the threshold.
o	Real-time detection allows immediate response to unusual conditions.

5.	Visualization:
o	Visualizes the reconstruction loss distribution to understand how well the model differentiates between normal and abnormal data.
